<h3 align="center">About Me:</h3>

As a bachelor's student in Computer Engineering at the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso, I'm taking the first steps on my journey into the world of computing and, more specifically, into the exciting area of data.

Although I don't yet have any practical experience in the industry, my passion and curiosity for data analysis are driving my daily learning. I am committed to acquiring the necessary skills to become a competent professional in this constantly evolving field.

I am currently focused on mastering the Python programming language, recognized for its usefulness and applicability in data science projects. Through online courses, tutorials and personal projects, I am exploring the various libraries and tools available in Python for data analysis and visualization.

My goal is to make the most of my academic experience, absorbing solid theoretical knowledge in areas such as statistics, mathematics and algorithms, while continuing to develop my practical skills through personal projects and collaborations with colleagues.

Although I'm only at the beginning of my journey, I'm determined to work hard, learn continuously and make a significant contribution to the field of data in the future.
